The solution is to ensure that you only access state variables after the component has finished mounting. You can do this by using the `useEffect` hook to perform an action after the component has finished rendering. This hook will ensure that your state variable is available and has been set before you try to access it.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [myState, setMyState] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Simulate an asynchronous operation that updates state
    setTimeout(() => {
      setMyState({ name: 'John Doe' });
    }, 1000);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      {/* Access myState only after it's been set */}
      {myState && <Text>Name: {myState.name}</Text>}
    </View>
  );
};
```

The `useEffect` hook ensures that the state variable is available before accessing it in the JSX. The null check (`myState && ...`) further prevents errors if the state is still null.
